# react-video-encoder
## Introduction
A React website which allows the user to upload a video file, and then receive an encoded version using ffmpeg.

This project was based on Visual Studios React.JS web app template.

# Setup
You need to download the executables for ffmpeg - (ffmpeg|ffprobe).exe - and add these to the project directory. 

You can find these [here](https://ffbinaries.com/downloads).

You will need to add the executables to ./ffmpeg/bin/(ffmpeg|ffprobe).exe
